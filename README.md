# restaurantPickerApp

A simple app made with ScalaFX for creating a database of restaurants so users can add, edit or randomly pick a restaurant from the database

There's also a very simple mini game (Rock Paper Scissors) and a food dictionary

So far there have been some incomplete parts such as the database not displaying the price ranges of the restaurants and some more that I have already forgotten, hahaha XD

## Functions

- Add, Edit and Delete restaurant entries in a database
- Generates the name of a random restaurant for the user if they can't choose where they want to eat
- Play a super simple mini game of Rock Paper Scissors (I threw this in just for a chance at getting more marks tbh)
- View the food dictionary

## Instructions

You'll need:
- JDK (project version: 8)

For ease, download IntelliJ IDEA and run the folder with it

Visual Studio Code works too
