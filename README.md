# restaurantPickerApp

A simple app made with ScalaFX for creating a database of restaurants so users can add, edit or randomly pick a restaurant from the database

There's also a very simple mini game (Rock Paper Scissors) and a food dictionary

So far there have been some incomplete parts such as the database not displaying the price ranges of the restaurants and some more that I have already forgotten, hahaha XD
